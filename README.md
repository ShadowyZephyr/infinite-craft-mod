This is a mod for the game "Infinite Craft" on neal.fun (https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/). Still a bit buggy.

This is intended to be used with TamperMonkey, but you can also just paste into the console every time you open the website.
If you are pasting into the console and it doesn't load, try running f() in the console.

IMPORTANT: For exporting path to work properly you MUST reset your progress before inserting the script, and don't combine without it on or it can't log those recipes.
