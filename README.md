This is a mod for the game "Infinite Craft" on neal.fun (https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/). Still a bit buggy.

This is intended to be used with TamperMonkey (the code is mod.js), but you can also just paste into the console every time you open the website.
If you are pasting into the console and it doesn't load, try running f() in the console.

IMPORTANT: For exporting path to work properly you MUST reset your progress before inserting the script, and don't combine without it on or it can't log those recipes.

HOW TO RUN:
- Click on the text "mod.js" and then click the arrow "Download raw file"
- Download TamperMonkey Chrome Extension
- Go to TamperMonkey in extensions and click "add new script" 
- Drag the mod.js file from your computer into the TamperMonkey Window
- Click "install"

When you load the mod, 4 buttons will appear:

AUTO CRAFT - Simply automatically crafts your elements together.

AUTO CRAFT WITH ELEMENT - Type in the element name, and it will craft that element together with every other element you have. Good for finding things similar to something you have.

EXPORT PATH - Type in the element name, and it saves a text file on your computer saying how to get that element.

IMPORT PATH - Select a path from your computer, and it tries to make all the elements in it. If an element in the path has the character "+" or "=" in it, it will break because it uses those to parse combinations.
Importing is still buggy, if it just stops for some reason, try doing it again, if not you can just make the elements manually.
